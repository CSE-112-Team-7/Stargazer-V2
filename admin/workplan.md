# **Workplan for Week 7 (5/13/24)**

> ## **Sprint Process:**

- `Sprint Length:` 1 week
- `Planning:` during the sprint meeting, we can consult our previous work plan and the list of tasks we want to get done to decide on which features/issues to take on in the next sprint
- `Reviews/Retrospectives:` meet at the end of the week to discuss the previous week’s sprint, what still needs to be done, issues that will be tackled in the upcoming sprint, and any changes/improvements that could be made to how sprints are done
- `Reports:` We will use Github Projects to create our burndown charts to report our work for the sprints
