# **Workplan for Week 6 (5/6/24)**


> ## **Sprint Process:**

- `Sprint Length:` 1 week
- `Planning:` during the sprint meeting, we can consult our previous work plan and the list of tasks we want to get done to decide on which features/issues to take on in the next sprint
- `Reviews/Retrospectives:` meet at the end of the week to discuss the previous weekâ€™s sprint, what still needs to be done, issues that will be tackled in the upcoming sprint, and any changes/improvements that could be made to how sprints are done
- `Reports:` We will use Github Projects to create our burndown charts to report our work for the sprints

> ## **Work Effort:**

- [x] Decide on Features for the Week
    - [x] Look at Features From [4/30 Actionable Items](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hwhq7ibQjWJYssQBBdxAG86LIwOKfw8UUtkbsWo5R6I/edit?usp=sharing)
    - [x] Decide which we are going to do
- [ ] Decide Tasks
    - [ ] Come up with subtasks from Features
- [ ] Create Github Issues & Board
    - [ ] Make Issues from subtasks
- [ ] Begin working on tasks

> ## **Estimations and Priorites:**
- Decide on Features (`HIGH`)
  - Reason: we cannot get to work if we do not know what features we need to implement
- Decide Tasks (`MEDIUM`)
  - Reason: tasks give developers direction
- Create Github Issues & Board (`LOW`)
  - Reason: a way to organize our tasks

> ## **Sequencing:**
- Decide on Features (`1st`)
- Decide Tasks (`2nd`)
- Create Github Issues & Board (`3rd`)
