# **Workplan for Week 7 (5/13/24)**

> ## **Sprint Process:**

- `Sprint Length:` 1 week
- `Planning:` during the sprint meeting, we can consult our previous work plan and the list of tasks we want to get done to decide on which features/issues to take on in the next sprint
- `Reviews/Retrospectives:` meet at the end of the week to discuss the previous weekâ€™s sprint, what still needs to be done, issues that will be tackled in the upcoming sprint, and any changes/improvements that could be made to how sprints are done
- `Reports:` We will use Github Projects to create our burndown charts to report our work for the sprints
