# **Workplan for Week 5 (5/4/24)**

> ## **Sprint Process:**

- `Sprint Length:` 1 week
- `Planning:` during the sprint meeting, we can consult our previous work plan and the list of tasks we want to get done to decide on which features/issues to take on in the next sprint
- `Reviews/Retrospectives:` meet at the end of the week to discuss the previous weekâ€™s sprint, what still needs to be done, issues that will be tackled in the upcoming sprint, and any changes/improvements that could be made to how sprints are done
- `Reports:` We will use Github Projects to create our burndown charts to report our work for the sprints

> ## **Work Effort:**

- [x] Feature Planning:
  - [x] Braindump: Brainstorm a list of possible features to implements  
    - [4/30: Feature Braindump](4_30_Feature_Braindump.pdf)

    - [4/30: Feature Breakdown](4_30_Feature_Breakdown.pdf)
- [x] Deep Repository Analysis:

- [ ] Setup Repository:
  - [x] Fork existing repository
  - [x] Invite team members
  - [ ] Setup Github Board/Issues
